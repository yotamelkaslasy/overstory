/**
 * Health check state machine and evaluation logic for agent monitoring.
 *
 * ZFC Principle (Zero Failure Crash)
 * ==================================
 * Observable state is the source of truth, not recorded state.
 *
 * Signal priority (highest to lowest):
 *   1. tmux session liveness  — Is the tmux session actually running?
 *   2. Process liveness (pid) — Is the Claude Code process still alive?
 *   3. Recorded state         — What does sessions.json claim?
 *
 * When signals conflict, always trust what you can observe:
 *   - tmux dead + sessions.json says "working" → mark zombie immediately.
 *     The recorded state is stale; the process is gone.
 *   - tmux alive + sessions.json says "zombie" → investigate, don't auto-kill.
 *     Something marked it zombie but the process recovered or was misclassified.
 *   - pid dead + tmux alive → the pane's shell survived but the agent process
 *     exited. Treat as zombie (the agent is not doing work).
 *   - pid alive + tmux dead → should not happen (tmux owns the pid), but if it
 *     does, trust tmux (the session is gone).
 *
 * Headless agents (tmuxSession === ''):
 *   Headless agents have no tmux session. For these, PID is the PRIMARY liveness
 *   signal. The tmuxAlive parameter is meaningless and ignored. ZFC rules are
 *   applied using PID liveness instead of tmux liveness.
 *
 * The rationale: sessions.json is updated asynchronously by hooks and can become
 * stale if the agent crashes between hook invocations. tmux and the OS process
 * table are always up-to-date because they reflect real kernel state.
